migration.archive.stream=Migrating archive [{0}] using streaming
migration.archiveFailed=Failed to migrate archive [{0}]. Using the "-zipInMemory" option may help.

where options includes:\n\
\    -logLevel=<name of java.util.logging.level enum value>\n\
\                Useful values are INFO (default), FINE or FINEST\n\
\    -profile=<profile name>\n\
\                TOMCAT (default) to convert Java EE APIs provided by Tomcat\n\
\                EE to convert all Java EE APIs\n\
\    -zipInMemory\n\
\                By default zip format archives (.zip, jar, .war, .ear, etc.)\n\
\                are processed in memory. This is more efficient but is not\n\
\                compatible with some zip archive structures. If you see an\n\
\                exception while processing a zip file, enabling this option\n\
\                may workaround the issue.
